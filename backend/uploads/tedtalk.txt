 I think that our creativity is becoming more and more of a means to an end. And that end is to get attention. There's these two powerful feelings. There's getting attention and paying attention. Of course, in the last decade or so, new technology has allowed more and more people to have this powerful feeling of getting attention. For any kind of creative expression, not just acting, it could be writing, or photography, or drawing, or music, everything. The channels of distribution have been democratized and that's a good thing. But I do think there's an unintended consequence for anybody on the planet with an urge to be creative. Myself included, because I'm not immune to this. And so I feel compelled to speak up because in my experience, the more I go after, that powerful feeling of paying attention, the happier I am. But the more I go after, the powerful feeling of getting attention, the unhappier I am.
